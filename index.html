  <h1>Achievements</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Graduation at 8-yeared Gymnasium in Kralupy</h2> 
  <p>After 8 years of studying I graduated from Czech, English, Physics and Biology. During high-school there was a pretty basic course of programming and IT, but definitely not enough for applying a job. At least there was a high-quality English class.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Successfully gone through a selection process of Greenfox Academy</h2>
  <p>After 6 years of working as full-time (mostly over-time) as a warehouseman, I became quite unsatisfied with my job and decided to make a change. I ran into a Greenfox Academy website while browsing the net, and what I found, was really interesting and gave me new drive. <br><br>I had to play two funky games, which helped the Greenfox mentors create a behavioral profile of me. After that I was invited to an chilled interview with organizational psychologist Daniel, which went actually pretty fine in my opinion. Last step for me was to attend a meeting with one mentor and one other attendant. We went throught a bit challenging algorithmical-programming simulation and of course, it was a success.</p>
